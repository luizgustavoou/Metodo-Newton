# Newton's Method
In numerical analysis, Newton's method, developed by Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, aims to estimate the roots of a function. An initial approximation is chosen for this purpose.

## Steps:

1. **Node**
   ```bash
   npm install mathjs
   node newton.js
   ```

   **Note:**
   Initial guess for function fa: 1.1
   Initial guess for function fb: 5.1
